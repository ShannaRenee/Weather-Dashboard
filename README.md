## Description
My motivation to make this weather dashboard was inspired by my desire to implement all of the new coding skills
I've learned recently. I made this weather dashboard so that users can see the current weather conditions for a 
certain city as well as the forecast for the next five days. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data needed
for this project. I also used some icons from FontAwesome to add a little more visual interest to the page. This
weather dashboard is simple enough to make it easy for users to see the most important weather info for anywhere
in the world. I learned so much during the process of putting this application together. It was my first time
getting accustumed to working with an API to extract data and I feel a lot more confident using fetch() to access 
and use information from an API. I also tried to use more comments to describe my code as well as using more
descriptive commit messages when pushing my commits.
